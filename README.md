# Assignment

Well, we are learning Wealthsimple app. I have screenshoted some pictures. And we can code them. If anyone finishes, you can just push the code up. I am new to Flutter, too. I think there are a lot of things to learn, such as how to connect all the code. I suggest everyone use your own dart class and encapuslate your code well, just in case of overwirteing or too hard to combine our codes. The total app is hard, but splitting it into many small pages is easier.
